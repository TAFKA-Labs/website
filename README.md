# TAFKA Labs website

## The stack

This site is a Next.js micro-app: static pages populated by data from GraphCMS. The site feels extremely responsive with a short time to first paint. Content can be written and managed via the (very friendly!) GraphCMS web interface.

## The design

Generally a work in progress. This site makes use of styled-components, the Moraga theme via Typography.js, and the [Chill Sunset color palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/70095).

## The setup

Not fancy. Hosted via GitHub Pages.
